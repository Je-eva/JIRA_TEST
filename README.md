## Scrum vs. Kanban
- **Scrum**: Work is managed in **sprints**, which are time-boxed periods where a set of tasks moves through phases until completed.
- **Kanban**: Work is managed through a **pull system**, where tasks are pulled from left to right (e.g., from "To Do" to "Done") based on resource availability.

---

## Project Structure
- **Project Name**: The overarching container for all work.
- **Epic**: High-level features (e.g., "Shopping Module") that represent larger goals and take weeks to complete.
  - **Story (User Story)**: Represents new functionality or a feature within the product.
  - **Bug**: Issues or errors identified during or after development.
  - **Task**: Work required to complete an item (e.g., configuration or testing).
  - **Subtasks**: The smallest work units under a story, usually taking a day or less to complete.

---

## Backlog Interface
- **Purpose**: Create and organize all issues (Epics, Stories, Bugs, Tasks).
- **Key Points**:
  - **Summary**: Ensure concise summaries for all issues.
  - **Parent Relationships**: 
    - Epics have no parents.
    - Stories, Tasks, and Bugs must be linked to a parent (typically an Epic).
  - Use the "Create Issue" shortcut to streamline issue creation.
  - Subtasks can be added to Stories for detailed tracking.
  - Assign Stories to Epics by dragging and dropping them onto the Epic tile.

---

## Managing Issues
- **Epics**:
  - Assign distinct colors for easier identification.
- **Labels**:
  - Use labels to categorize similar Stories, Tasks, or Bugs.
  - Labels must be single words (e.g., `user_story_category`).
  - Assign labels quickly by selecting an issue and pressing `L`.
- **Components**:
  - Subsections within a project (e.g., "iOS", "macOS").
  - Link components to Stories through the details tab.

---

## Filtering and Categorization
- **Filter by Label**: Identify and group related issues.
- **Filter by Epic**: Focus on issues within a specific Epic.
- **Filter by Version**: Prioritize issues tied to a particular release.

---

## Components and Releases
- **Components**: Use these to group issues within a project (e.g., "iOS" or "Backend").
- **Releases**:
  - Track project versions.
  - Use the "V" shortcut in the backlog to access version control.
  - Drag and drop Stories into the desired version.
  - A green progress bar in the version indicates how much work has been completed.

---

## Backlog Grooming
- **Key Actions**:
  1. Ensure every issue is connected to an Epic.
  2. Verify all issues are assigned to a version.
  - Rank issues by priority within a version for better focus.
  - Bugs related to a Story should be ranked immediately below that Story.
- **Prioritization**:
  - Use team discussions to assign priority numbers.
  - Include visuals to indicate story points and their meanings.

## Creating and Configuring Boards
- **Basic Workflow**:
  - Columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "Done".
  - Customize columns in the board configuration for real-life workflows.
- **Done Column**:
  - When dragging a task to "Done", you may be prompted to update the parent issue.

---

## Sprint Reports
- **Purpose**: Provide insights into sprint progress and outcomes.
  - Identify which issues were completed and which were not.
  - Use this information to make strategic plans for future sprints.
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - A green progress line in the sprint report shows the amount of work completed.

---

## Tips for Success
1. Use shortcuts (e.g., `L` for labels, `V` for versions) to save time.
2. Continuously groom the backlog to maintain focus and clarity.
3. Customize boards and filters to match your teamâ€™s workflow.

- **Bulk Select (`Shift + Click`)**: Select multiple issues for batch actions.  
- **Drag and Drop**: Assign Stories to Epics or Versions by dragging them.  
- **Filter by Labels**: Use a single word or `_` for multi-word labels.  
- **Epic Panel**: Collapse or expand Epics in the backlog for better focus.
